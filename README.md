## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **solar-powered smart irrigation system** that automates watering based on soil conditions and environmental data. The system is designed to optimize water usage, reduce human intervention, and ensure reliable operation in remote farming areas using renewable energy.

The system integrates **IoT (Internet of Things)**, **renewable energy**, and **automation** to support smart farming applications. Real-time monitoring and control are provided through **Blynk** and **Telegram**, while data is logged in **Google Sheets** for analysis and performance tracking.
